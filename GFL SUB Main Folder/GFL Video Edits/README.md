# Rerecord

These cutscenescan be remade in-game, with mods on.

- int_hudson_explains_1
- int_hudson_explains_2
- int_reznov_disappearing_flashback
- TBH, almost all `int` files can be remade in-game
- `jfk_flash_1` is just `dragovich_flash_1` except with `jfk_flash_2`
- almost all `dragovich_flash` clips are taken from the same source.
- `hudson_glasses` could be replaced by in-game clips of M16.
- int_drag_krav_stein_flash
- int_kennedy_pentagon_flash
- int_reznov_huecity_flash
- int_reznov_room (some squares will be replaced by an image of UMP40. Preferably one where she's staring at you)
- int_steiner_wmd_flash

# Possible ignore

These videos might be safely ignored because there is almost no characters that we can recognize in these, or they are effects you can use.
- vorkuta_load
- int_flaming_limo
- int_morgue_doors - These are the effects you can use
- int_number_field - also a usable effect
- int_number_flash_1 - effect that can be overlaid
- int_rusalka_numbers_2 - effect
- int_shocking - effect
- kennedy_screens - should be replaced with something else. 
- split_512x600 - the videos on the side of USDD
