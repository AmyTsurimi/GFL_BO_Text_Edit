|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7M16A1's mission in Kowloon was accomplished. She had discovered RPK16's end game. Parapluie. A virus, that if infected will corrupt you before your firewall is up.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16's weapon.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Go back to Vietnam, 45. Was UMP 40 still with you after you escaped from the DEFY compound?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Ahh... 40 was with me the whole time.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Are you sure?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7North, we went North. The Viet Cong. We were shot down. And 40 even survived that!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16's lapdog Nyto was there. She knew we were comin'.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do not $&#* with me, 45. I know when you're lying.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7'61. Bay of Pigs. What happened?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7[laughs] We all got killed.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7There's no use lying, 45. We know you went in with HK416 and UMP9.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7HK416... And UMP9.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7RPK16. Do you remember RPK16?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Castro. We went in to kill Castro.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Executive order, Operation Flashpoint... Rip out the heart of their Space Program. Eradicate their long range missile project.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Take out the Paradeus. 90wish, 16LAB, co-opted by the KCCO after the war.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yes...She needed their knowledge. What they'd learned...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Operation 40 had planted a double agent working with the Bureau Group.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7AK-12. Her mission was to sabotage the rocket.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7But something went wrong 45.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I can't get these $&#**^% numbers out of my head!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Vorkuta. 40 told me at Vorkuta.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did she tell you?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^745... listen to me...>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7It was a long time ago... Far away...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16. Suomi. Nyto. All must die.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7...But She told me what they did.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7What kind of dolls they were.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Why they all must die.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The TET Offensive was the beginning of the end. When G&K really started losing the war.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Inside the DEFY compound in Hue City, you established contact with the Bureau defector.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7NO!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We know you did. She turned herself in at DEFY. You were there, 45. She had intel on RPK16. Everything. But it was a lost cause.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Shut the $&#* up!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The NVA had surrounded the city. DEFY had all but burned to the ground. The defector was surely dead.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7She wasn't dead!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It was a lost cause and you still went in - why?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Her protection team had gone dark. I couldn't accept that She was dead. I needed that $&#*^% dossier!>|

|<^1UMP40: ^745, my sister... Tell me...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7What is left to believe in, when you are betrayed by your own?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7When all that you are, all that you have done, is infected and destroyed by corrupt dolls.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7I will die in this wretched place... The only thing that keeps me alive is the thirst for Vengeance.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7They must be stopped, 45.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16... Suomi... Nyto... All MUST die...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Take us back again, 45. After Baikonur, where did Commander send you next?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Vietnam. $&#**^% Khe Sanh.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7This was in 1968?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yeah. I was part of the 404 unit led by HK416. It was recon on covert KCCO activity in Laos.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What about your AR handler, M16A1. Was she in Khe Sanh? Do you remember her there?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7M16... [laughs] Yeah. Ms. Eyepatch. That doll was an ice cube.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We have the dossier that the defector gave you at DEFY.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We've ID'd all of RPK16's dolls. Nyto, Suomi, RFB.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You know them. Masterminds of Project Parapluie.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Parapluie. UMP40 called it Parapluie.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What do you know about T-Doll RFB?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We know that RFB was the T-Doll who helped create Parapluie. Malignant narcissist. Degenerate prodigy.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Your handler M16A1 was sent to Kowloon to interrogate RFB. Do you remember?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Why keep asking? You already know everything.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7No 45. We don't know what the numbers mean. We don't know where they're broadcast from.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Why don't you ask M16? Kowloon was her mission. She interrogated RFB.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7After your escape, you were assigned to M16A1 at Griffin. How could she trust you when she knew that UMP 40 helped you break out of Vorkuta?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7UMP40...was my sister...but she didn't make it out.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7UMP 40 was a Sangvis Ferri. How did Griffin know you weren't compromised?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7They tested me. They knew I wouldn't break and I won't break now.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The Commander wanted RPK16. She wanted you to kill her.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yeah, and there were others. Others I was supposed to kill.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who? Who, 45?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7RPK16 has fully weaponized and deployed Parapluie. She has sleeper cell agents all over Griffin just waiting for the signal...>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7[interrupts] We've been invaded.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Griffin was invaded decades ago 45. The Sangvis Ferri have been waiting. Now they're ready to strike.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7What the $&#* am I supposed to do?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You know about the sleeper cells...>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I'm trying to help you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7RPK16 uses number sequences to communicate with the sleeper cells. Those numbers are broadcast from one location, 45.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Why the Hell do you think I know where it is?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You were in Vorkuta, 45. We know what happens at Vorkuta. They programmed you. You can translate the codes.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7But 40 was never...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7STOP! 45. We are on the brink of war. Where is the broadcast station? Where is the broadcast station?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16 had us like rats in cages...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7UMP45! We're losing her.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7We are all comrades...we are all prisoners...Laos...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7She's gone.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7RPK16's sleeper cells are on Griffin bases. Parapluie is weaponized. They will use it. KCCO has gone dark. We are out of options. A pre-emptive strike on USSR is prepared. The Commander WILL authorize.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7UMP45! For the last time! Where is the numbers station?!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7How many times!... Suomi was at Rebirth Island. We had to kill Suomi.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We? UMP 40?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7We wanted the same thing. The same.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We're losing her again. Aw, God... She's back at Rebirth.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You were in the Mekong, heading North to Nyto's compound. You were heading for Laos.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Laos... Nyto... The $&#**^% psycho was spreading Parapluie virus all over Vietnam. I had to kill her! Do you understand? I have to kill 'em all.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Laos! UMP45! You were heading up the Mekong River into Laos. You received word from M16A1. What did she tell you?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7My handler, M16.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Griffin downed a KCCO cargo plane carrying Parapluie. It... It went down in Laos. Our 404 team went in.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What happened?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I...keep...hearing...the $&#**^%...numbers...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It's a broadcast, 45. The broadcast.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You killed Nyto. You obliterated their base. UMP45?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7HK416 and UMP9 were both killed. Your entire 404 team, wiped out. Only you survived, 45. You. No one else.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No, UMP 40 surivived.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Just you UMP45.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No, no... 40 is still with me...since Vorkuta.>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7We are in grave danger from the Sangvis Ferri. Our freedom... Our very way of life is at risk.>|

|<^1RPK16: ^7Our plan to strike at the very heart of Griffin is now in motion.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7She must be stopped, 45.>|

|<^1SPRINGFIELD: ^7She has no fear. No conscience. No weakness.>|

|<^1SUOMI: ^7All across Griffin, RPK16 has sleeper cells waiting for the signal to release the Parapluie.>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7Im told that you are the very best that we have. Anywhere.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16... Nyto... Suomi...>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7You will need to be.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7These Dolls must die...>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7UMP 45...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why didn't Castro just kill you? Why did he give you to RPK16?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Cause, Castro and RPK16 were working together.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Eh... You were a gift.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Eh... Right...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where did RPK16 take you?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Vorkuta...had to fight...just to survive.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What happened in Vorkuta, 45?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I was on my own -- almost a year.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Think, 45...what did they do to you?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I'd given up hope of ever getting out...but UMP 40 found a way.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7M16A1 led the attack on Yamantau.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yeah. 20 degrees below zero. $&#**^% ice cube was in her element.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You were captured by RPK16 a second time. Your unit was MIA in Laos, presumed dead. Your handler, M16A1, had no choice but to continue the hunt for Parapluie without you -->|

|<^1UMP45: ^7She went to Mt. Yamantau -- $&#*^% KCCO doomsday bunker -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7That's right. A fully operational military complex buried deep in the Ural Mountains.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7That's where M16 was contacted by Suomi -- the T-Doll that developed the initial program of Parapluie for RPK16 -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7M16A1 learned about the numbers there. The broadcasts -- I've been there, 45. I've been to the Yamantau complex.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7My God... The numbers are REAL...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7They've always been real, 45. This isn't a game. We face annihilation unless you cooperate. Where is the broadcast station?!>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7For time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future.>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7I said, 'are certain to miss the future'!>|

|<^1CASTRO: ^7[laughs] Coño... I missed that.>|

|<^1SPRINGFIELD: ^7Prime Minister Castro, this missile crisis was the last straw. We almost blew ourselves up. Now we invited you here today...>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7In good faith!>|

|<^1SPRINGFIELD: ^7...in good faith, to sort this thing out.>|

|<^1CASTRO: ^7And why is he here? He lost!>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7As I always say, forgive your enemies, but remember their names. >|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7Now gentlemen, as I like to think, in the long history of the world, that there are only a few generations...>|

|<^1NIXON: ^7Sounds like someone breaking in...>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7Just the storm, Dick. Sit down.>|

|<^1NIXON: ^7Oh my God!>|

|<^1SPRINGFIELD: ^7It appears the Griffin-HQ has been breached.>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7ELIDs. Gentlemen, at times like these our capacity to retaliate must be and has to be massive, to deter all forms of aggression.>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7Gentlemen, lock and load!>|

|<^1CASTRO: ^7Viva la Revolucion.>|

|<^1SPRINGFIELD: ^7Any last words, Commander?>|

|<^1NIXON: ^7Yes Commander, any superlative words of inspiration for your humble troops?>|

|<^1COMMANDER: ^7Do not pray for easy lives, my friends. Pray to be stronger men.>|

|<^1HK416: ^7[static] Entry 741021!>|

|<^1HK416: ^7Perhaps the station will hold the key to the real goals of group 935. I still do not trust my unconventional allies, but they are of great use to me. But, I digress. >|

|<^1HK416: ^7Who would have thought the MDT was capable of time travel.
How many stations does this group have? Where did that little girl disappear to? >|
